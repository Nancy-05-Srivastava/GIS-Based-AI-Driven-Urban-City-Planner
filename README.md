# Biodiversity Risk Assessment Platform

This repository contains the code and documentation for a platform designed to assess biodiversity risk. The platform utilizes geospatial analysis and statistical methods to provide valuable insights for conservation efforts.

**Key Features:**

* **GIS Data Processing:** Processes and analyzes various geospatial data sources, including satellite imagery, elevation data, and climate data.
* **Biodiversity Risk Assessment:** Develops and implements statistical models to assess biodiversity risk across different regions.
* **Interactive Mapping:** Provides an intuitive web interface with interactive maps for visualizing biodiversity risk, identifying hotspots, and exploring conservation priorities.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates informative visualizations, such as heatmaps, choropleth maps, and time-series plots, to communicate complex data effectively.

**Project Components:**

* **Data Processing Pipeline:** Scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
* **Statistical Models:** Statistical models for biodiversity risk assessment (e.g., regression models, spatial autoregressive models).
* **Web Application:** Frontend and backend code for the interactive web interface.
* **Data Repository:** A curated collection of geospatial and biodiversity data.
