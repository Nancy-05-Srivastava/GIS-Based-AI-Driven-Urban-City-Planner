# Ecopolis – AI-Driven Urban Biodiversity Planner

Welcome to **Ecopolis**, an innovative platform designed to assist urban planners in making sustainable, biodiversity-conscious decisions during urban development. As urbanization expands rapidly, ecosystems often face the threat of degradation due to human intervention. **Ecopolis** leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to help urban planners assess and mitigate the impact of urbanization on local ecosystems.

---

## 🌍 **Overview**

Ecopolis is built to bridge the gap between urban development and ecosystem preservation. It provides actionable insights into biodiversity risks, hotspots, and sustainable design recommendations using cutting-edge AI and GIS technologies.

### **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Urban Planning**: Predict the effects of urbanization on biodiversity using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **GIS-Based Visualization**: Interactive maps for identifying biodiversity hotspots, vegetation cover, and urban land use patterns.
- **Impact Prediction**: Upload aerial images or GIS files to predict biodiversity risks, segmentation patterns, and assess sustainable alternatives.
- **Sustainability Recommendations**:
  - Optimal green corridor identification.
  - Preservation of native vegetation.
  - Suggestions for biodiversity-friendly infrastructure (e.g., green roofs, vertical gardens).

Whether you're an urban planner, environmentalist, or sustainability advocate, **Ecopolis** empowers you to create cities that harmonize with nature, fostering ecological balance for future generations.

## 🛠️ **General Approach**

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Use GIS tools like **QGIS** or Python libraries (e.g., `Geopandas`) to gather spatial data.
- Publicly available datasets from sources like **OpenStreetMap**, **USGS Earth Explorer**, and **WorldClim** provide urban, biodiversity, and climate data.
- Create a historical dataset comparing urbanized areas to pre-urbanization landscapes.

### **2. Biodiversity Visualization**
- Utilize GIS data to map urban areas, vegetation, water bodies, and biodiversity hotspots.
- Design an interactive tool to zoom into city maps and display biodiversity metrics for specific locations.

### **3. Impact Prediction Model**
- Develop a segmentation model to analyze aerial imagery for land use patterns.
- Predict the effects of urbanization using machine learning models trained on parameters like:
  - Climate data (e.g., temperature, precipitation).
  - Vegetation and green cover changes.
  - Infrastructure development patterns.

### **4. Sustainability Recommendation Engine**
- Based on model predictions, suggest modifications to urban plans:
  - Identify regions for green corridors.
  - Preserve native vegetation.
  - Recommend sustainable infrastructure additions like green walls and roofs.

### **5. Web Interface**
- Build an intuitive interface using **Flask** or **Dash**:
  - Upload GIS files or aerial imagery.
  - Display biodiversity hotspots and prediction results.
  - Provide actionable recommendations for urban plans.

## 🧪 **Case Study**
Ecopolis can be applied to a real-world urban area (e.g., a city undergoing rapid urbanization). Demonstrate its impact by:
- Visualizing biodiversity changes over two decades.
- Predicting biodiversity risks from planned urban expansions.
- Generating recommendations for sustainable development.
